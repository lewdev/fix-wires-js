# 🛰️ fix-wires-js
The Fix Wiring mini game from Among Us written in JavaScript canvas. You can play this with a mouse or touch screen.

I initially started this as a dweet (on [Dwitter](https://beta.dwitter.net)) and then it just became a larger project. So much of the code is minified and not very readable. I did leave comments though. It oddly took a long time to implement touch capability.

I might go back and turn it into more readable code. But it was fun figuring out how to use mouse and touch actions.
